                    <h3>Why this recipe : </h3>
                    <p>I'm from the south of France. Where I grew up, there's a lot of duck farms. </p> 
                    <p> I even remember my uncle cuting the throat of a duck in my garden when I was a child... The sight of a headless duck running and screraming in the backyard still haunt me to this day.</p>
                    <p>But I grow up loving duck meat.</p> 
                    <p>Older, I really perfected my cooking ability by learning risotto. It became a dish that I make often and I can say that my risotto is not so bad.</p>
                    <p>One day, I had some really good confit duck legs and I didn't know what to do to honor the death of the animal. Why don't I put some duck confit in my favorite risotto ?</p> 
                    <p>I googled Duck risotto and I cook it it was delicious one of my favorite dish</p>
                    <p>Hope you'll enjoy it ! </p>

            <h3>Instructions : </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Place the mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with boiling water. Pour the broth into a saucepan and keep it hot but not
                    simmering as you prepare the risotto.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>In a large, deep sauté pan, heat oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring,
                    until just soft. Add the rice and cook, stirring, 1 minute.</p>
                </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Add the broth, little by little, stirring constantly and adding more broth when the previous addition has been
                            absorbed. Continue stirring and adding broth until the rice is just al dente, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain and chop the
                            mushrooms and stir them into the rice. Stir in the duck meat and cook until heated through.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Remove the pan from the heat and fold in the remaining butter. Stir in the Parmesan, adjust seasoning and
                            serve.</p>
